# Jester: Android Gesture Recognition

Ever wanted to be able to transform graphical objects in your Android app with touch gestures? Unfortunately, native gesture recognition on Android is kind of lacking. This library seeks to:

* Improve the gesture recognition ability of native Android, adding translation and rotation detection (Android already has scale detection, but we add it too)
* Add the ability to transform graphical objects using a gesture.


The included test app shows the library working with a single rectangle.
